
# CloudTagger

A tag cloud based image browsing UI utilizing semantic distances provided by cortical.io’s Retina REST API.


## Installation

This is a work in progress. At the moment all included resources should be imported into your Java project using the above file structure. 

Third-party libraries are included in the library folder.

Necessary resources:

- The current tag library is stored in /res/tags.txt 
- Semantic distances retrieved by the Retina API are stored in /distances.txt
- Example images and their respective tags are stored in /images.txt

Min. requirements: Java SE 8 Update 65

## Usage

Import images of choice. Images can be tagged via dragging the desired tag out of the tag cloud onto the target image - removal of tags is possible via right-click and context menu. The tag cloud browser interface allows different “zoom” levels (1x-4x)determining the amount of steps taken while moving through the semantic distances. 

Adding new tags is currently not (yet) implemented.
